            <h2>1. Flatness</h2>
            <p><span class="clickable" id="part-one">From inside the cave...</span></p>

            <p>A person sits facing a blank wall of rock. It is grey, slightly textured- as all natural cave walls tend to be, but they wouldn’t know that- and overall not much to look at. Not very interesting, anyways. From somewhere unknown, they hear a noise- sudden, quick, not something they’ve heard before- that pulls them from their mind into the present. And suddenly, <span class="clickable" id="first-change">something appears on the wall- </span> darker than the wall, and certainly shaped like nothing they’ve ever seen before. A voice booms “___”, and they know what it is. It is a “___”. How could it be anything else? The voice said so, and the voice knows, has always known, so it must be correct.</p>

            <p>They sit and stare at the thing for a while, taking it all in. And then, all of the sudden it seems again, that sound- <span class= "clickable" id="second-change">and the “___” goes away, something else taking its place- </span>something else new.</p> It doesn’t resemble the “___” in anything but colour, still darker than the cave wall. The voice booms again, “___”. They take a moment to study the “___”, same as before. It has a different word attached to it. It has a different name. It must be- no, it is a different thing. The person briefly wonders where the other thing, the “___” went, but no more sound comes and no more things appear, least of all the “___” from before.


            <p>Flatness is, among other things, the concept that seeing is believing- that things are black and white and should be taken at face value because that’s all there is. To me, flatness is stubbornness- either the unknowing or the unwillingness to know things other than what you perceive to be objectively correct. ___. The people (or person in my example) experiences Flatness in a lot of different ways. For one, the images they are seeing are flat shadows projected on a cave wall- although they don’t know that. In proving my definition though, the person in the cave has never been outside and neither have they seen a __ or a __. Nor can they stand behind the sources of illumination and see that the __ and the ___ are made of the same blocks, just with different parts being lit up to form different shadows. They just see images formed of shadow, and because they are given two different names, they think those two things are different, and that’s it- never even sparing a thought to investigate because what they see is true, and that’s that. Their worldview is Flat because they know only one way of thinking, and they are not able, nor would they think to try and perceive or think of the world and its objects any other way.</p>
