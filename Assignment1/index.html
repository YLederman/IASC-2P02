            <h2>1. Flatness</h2>
            <p><span class="clickable" id="part-one">From inside the cave...</span></p>

            <p>A person sits facing a blank wall of rock. It is grey, slightly textured- as all natural cave walls tend to be, but they wouldn’t know that- and overall not much to look at. Not very interesting, anyways. From somewhere unknown, they hear a noise- sudden, quick, not something they’ve heard before- that pulls them from their mind into the present. And suddenly, <span class="clickable" id="first-change">something appears on the wall- </span> darker than the wall, and certainly shaped like nothing they’ve ever seen before. A voice booms “___”, and they know what it is. It is a “___”. How could it be anything else? The voice said so, and the voice knows, has always known, so it must be correct.</p>

            <p>They sit and stare at the thing for a while, taking it all in. And then, all of the sudden it seems again, that sound- <span class= "clickable" id="second-change">and the “___” goes away, something else taking its place- </span>something else new.</p> It doesn’t resemble the “___” in anything but colour, still darker than the cave wall. The voice booms again, “___”. They take a moment to study the “___”, same as before. It has a different word attached to it. It has a different name. It must be- no, it is a different thing. The person briefly wonders where the other thing, the “___” went, but no more sound comes and no more things appear, least of all the “___” from before.


            <p>Flatness is, among other things, the concept that seeing is believing- that things are black and white and should be taken at face value because that’s all there is. To me, flatness is stubbornness- either the unknowing or the unwillingness to know things other than what you perceive to be objectively correct. ___. The people (or person in my example) experiences Flatness in a lot of different ways. For one, the images they are seeing are flat shadows projected on a cave wall- although they don’t know that. In proving my definition though, the person in the cave has never been outside and neither have they seen a __ or a __. Nor can they stand behind the sources of illumination and see that the __ and the ___ are made of the same blocks, just with different parts being lit up to form different shadows. They just see images formed of shadow, and because they are given two different names, they think those two things are different, and that’s it- never even sparing a thought to investigate because what they see is true, and that’s that. Their worldview is Flat because they know only one way of thinking, and they are not able, nor would they think to try and perceive or think of the world and its objects any other way.</p>

            <h2>2. Seeing Double</h2>
            <p><span class="clickable" id="part-two">From outside the cave...</span></p>
            <p>A person stands outside of the cave, looking in. The sun had set, leaving it dark outside. They take a step forward, trying to see the interior, and their foot bumps something- a pile of sticks of wood, all burned at the tips. Curious, they pick one up and examine it- a torch, perhaps, burnt out a while ago- and then pull flint and steel from their pocket and strike it up, raising it to see. <span class="clickable" id="third-change">They wave the torch back and forth,</span> trying to discern any of the details of the contents of the cave. Slowly, things are revealed. First, stalactites, hanging from the cave ceiling in all sorts of odd shapes and casting shadows onto the cave wall. First a ___, and then as their torch swept to the side, it changed to a ___, and then back again. Then a person, sitting a distance in front of the stalactites, head pointed towards the cave wall. 

            After a moment of further examining, <span class="clickable" id="fourth-change">they begin to walk forward,</span> still carrying the torch overhead. As they moved, the images shrunk, slowly and slowly until they passed the stalactites and stood right behind the other person- the images gone now from the cave wall. Quietly they hold their hand out to the person on the floor. They take it.
                
            <span class="clickable" id="fifth-change">And as they walk together out of the cave,</span> one looking around in wonder and the other leading the way, the torchlight falls on the stalactites again, bringing the shadows back and making them bigger and bigger until the two leave the cave entirely.</p>

            <p>Seeing Double is, for the most part, the opposite of Flat sight (discussed earlier). If Flatness is taking things at face value and a black and white world, Seeing Double is the nuance and complexity, and the grey areas to the world. Seeing Double, to me at least, means gathering different viewpoints and opinions and allowing yourself to step into other people’s shoes and minds to consider the world in ways outside of whatever your immediate thoughts and opinions happen to be. This is shown too in the cave, with the person on the outside having a different view than the person on the inside- and only together can these people’s views paint the whole picture of the situation. On the outside, the watcher sees that there are no ___ or ___ in the cave, as the first person thinks, but instead naturally growing stalactites hanging from the ceiling. Torches (that were presumably lit by the mystery Voice from before, and now the watcher is lighting again) were the things that created the shadows on the wall, that the cave-dweller was seeing and believing were real ___ and ___. The person in the cave believes that the objects shown on the cave wall are real, while the person on the outside sees stalactites that are casting shadows onto the wall and forming images (specifically images of a ___ and a ___). These two realms are connected when the watcher moves to the viewer’s perspective, and the viewer leaves the cave and sees the watcher’s perspective. As stated before, they See Double by seeing a view they had not previously encountered before- expanding their view of the situation and the world at large. </p>
